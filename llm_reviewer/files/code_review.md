## Code Review Summary: Pull Request Analysis 

This document summarizes the findings from a recent code review of a pull request focused on modifications to `src/pages/PaginaPrincipal.js`. The review identified several areas for improvement, primarily related to styling practices, component state management, and render function logic.

**Key Issues & Suggested Improvements:**

* **Direct Style Injection**:  The reviewed code utilized direct style injection within the CSS file. This practice is discouraged as it can lead to inconsistent styles and make maintenance more difficult. 
    * **Suggested Improvement:** Utilize CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Emotion to encapsulate styles within individual components, promoting modularity and reusability.

* **Multiple States for a Single Component**: The code defined multiple state variables (`visible`, `isVisible`) for managing the visibility of a single component element. This can lead to confusion and potential inconsistencies.
    * **Suggested Improvement:**  Employ a single state variable dedicated to controlling the element's visibility and update it accordingly based on user interactions.

* **Inline Logic in Render Function**: The render function contained logic directly within its return statement, leading to potentially complex and hard-to-read code. 
    * **Suggested Improvement**: Move logic to separate methods or utilize lifecycle effects to execute code on each render, enhancing readability and maintainability.


**Impact of Suggested Changes:**

Implementing these suggestions will significantly improve the code's quality and adherence to best practices:

* **Enhanced Code Maintainability**: Encapsulated styles and simplified state management will make the code easier to understand, modify, and debug.
* **Improved Performance**: CSS-in-JS libraries often optimize style application, potentially leading to performance gains.  
* **Increased Reusability**: Components with encapsulated styles can be more readily reused across different parts of the application.

**Overall Conclusion:**


The reviewed code demonstrates several areas where improvements can be made to enhance its quality and maintainability. By adopting the suggested changes, the codebase will benefit from increased clarity, better performance, and greater adherence to modern development practices.
